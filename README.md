# weather-journal-app

This app uses an external api to extract the temperature of the location entered by the user.
It then displays the User's feeling(which is entered by the user) and the temperature and current date.
This basic app was build by me to practice on extracting data from external api.

# How to use

- [ ] Just run the command 'node server.js' on this app's root directory(node.js should be installed in your computer).
